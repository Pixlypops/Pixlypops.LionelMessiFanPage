                        Lionel Messi was born on June 24, 1987, in Rosario, Argentina. From an early age, it was evident that he had exceptional talent. Messi joined the local club Newell's Old Boys at the age of 6, where he quickly gained a reputation as a football prodigy. However, his career faced a significant challenge when he was diagnosed with growth hormone deficiency at age 10. His family could not afford the treatment, which cost approximately $1,000 per month.

                        At the age of 13, Messi caught the attention of FC Barcelona scouts. After a successful trial in Barcelona, the club agreed to pay for his medical treatment, and Messi moved to Spain with his family. He joined La Masia, Barcelona's famed youth academy, where his talent continued to flourish.

His partnership with players like Xavi Hernández and Andrés Iniesta was instrumental in Barcelona's dominance in both domestic and European competitions.
